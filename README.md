# multiLeadSegmentation
Multi lead segmentation algorithm exploiting inter-lead information and redundancy of the signal for robust delineation of the QRS complex in ECG signals. Based on R-DECO for R-peak detection, and ECG-kit for Q and S detection for each lead, combined with post-processing rules for multi-lead extension.,
